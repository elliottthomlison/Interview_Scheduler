# Interview Scheduler
Interview Scheduler is a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews. The app allows the user to book, cancel, edit, and delete appointments. The user can select interview time slots and select the interviewer of their choosing. It is the fourth project that is built during the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp. It was built through the use of React, Storybook, and the use of a scheduler-api. Difficulties and challenges arose because of my initial unfamilarity of React.
